# üé¨ Bollywood Movie Recommendation System (Using MCP)

Welcome to the **Bollywood Movie Recommendation System**! This demo showcases how the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** can be used to store and utilize context (like user preferences) for personalized experiences in recommending Bollywood movies.

## üí° **What is MCP?**

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a way of storing data (such as preferences or history) in a way that allows a system to **make decisions** based on this data over time. In this app:
- **MCP** stores the **user's preferred movie genre** (e.g., Action, Romantic, Comedy).
- **MCP** also keeps track of the **last 5 movie recommendations** to **personalize the movie suggestions**.

When a user selects a genre, the app **updates the context** (genre and movie history) and then shows **personalized recommendations** accordingly.
